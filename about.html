    <h1 class="center">Who am I?</h1>
        <p class="abouttext">My name is Jáchym and I am a 17 year old high school student at the High School of Applied Cybernetics in Hradec Králové.</p>
        <p class="abouttext">I am in the second year now, knowing the basics of C# and currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
        <p class="abouttext">While I am interested in programming, so far web development and graphic design (mainly working in Photoshop) are my favourite and i enjoy them far more.</p>
        <p class="abouttext">My main interests are music and games, i really enjoy tinkering with and modding old consoles and i (so far unsuccessfully) like to mess around in FL studio.</p>
        <h3 class="abouttext">Here are some of my favourite games and music albums: </h3>

            <h2>IGOR by Tyler, the Creator</h2>
            <p>Igor is one of my favourite albums of all time, it introduced me to Tyler as a whole.</p>
            <p>This album is still amazing to me. Even after 5 years all the tracks still have replay value and im still finding new stuff i like about each one. Its definitely one of those albums i gotta listen to the whole way through instead of just a song. </p>
            <p>Tyler cemented himself as a legend with this. It proved that the the success of his previous album Flower Boy wasn’t a fluke, it was a part of his continued evolution as a highly respected artist. </p>

                <h2>BLOND by Frank Ocean</h2>
                <p>Frank Ocean’s "Blond" is one of the most timeless albums I’ve ever heard. Its dreamy production, introspective lyrics, and seamless flow make it an unforgettable experience. It’s the kind of album you can listen to at any moment and still feel like it’s speaking to you personally.</p>
                <p>My favorite track, "Nights," stands out with its incredible composition and emotional depth. The mid-song beat switch is one of the most mesmerizing moments in music for me. Every song on this album feels like a story, and together they form a beautiful, cohesive narrative that leaves a lasting impression.</p>

                <h2>KATANA ZERO</h2>
                <p>Katana zero is one of my favourite games of all time. It is a small indie game released in 2019 by a solo developer.</p>
                <p>it’s a side-scrolling hack-and-slash game with stunning pixel art, a captivating soundtrack, and intense gameplay mechanics. The action is fast-paced, but the game also has moments of calm that let you unravel its deep and thought-provoking story.</p>
                <p>The narrative is one of its strongest points. As you progress, you uncover layers of a complex plot that keeps you hooked. It’s a game that challenges not just your reflexes but also your mind, and it’s one of the reasons why it remains a favorite of mine to this day.</p>
